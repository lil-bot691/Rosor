His favourite subject was of course Web Development, and that is because he really likes his teacher Andreas! All of his achievements didn't come from nothing, he is really hard working and has a passion for everything he does. He was the one with his knowledge of Web Development, to create this wonderful website. So thank you Leo! </p></body></html>
